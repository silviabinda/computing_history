## About
Computing History is a reminder that the history of computing is not a masculine monopoly. Materialized through three open hardware artefacts, this reminder playfully remembers the pioneering contributions of women in computing.

The module on the left honours Ada Lovelace, who wrote the first algorithm intended for future computer machines. On the LCD display, a short biography of Ada is visualized, while the real-time generated melody uses the years of her birth and death to determine the sound frequencies.

The other module pays tribute to Grace Hopper, who contributed to the invention of the compiler. While her achievements are looped as text on the display, her name is visualized as a Morse code sequence using blinking blue light-emitting diodes.
